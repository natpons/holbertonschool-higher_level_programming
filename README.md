## Requirements

### General

-   Allowed editors:  `vi`,  `vim`,  `emacs`
-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using  `python3`  (version 3.4.3)
	-   All your files should end with a new line
	-   The first line of all your files should be exactly  `#!/usr/bin/python3`
	-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
	-   Your code should use the  `PEP 8`  style (version 1.7.*)
	-   All your files must be executable
	-   The length of your files will be tested using  `wc`
